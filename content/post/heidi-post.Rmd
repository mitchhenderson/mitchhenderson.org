As sports scientists during the COVID-19 shutdown, we have limited ways of determining adherence to training programs (completed within govenment guidelines of course!).

Data from smart watches provide practitioners with *basic measures* that can be used as a *rough guide* to quantify training over this period (when using the more sophisticated technologies isn't possible).

Although the reliability and validity data of these devices aren't widely available, they provide basic metrics such as total distance, duration, heart rate, and energy burnt etc.

In this post I'll run through how to: 

- export this data without an [API](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Application_programming_interface) 
- run some some basic analysis
- manipulate and visualise the data using `dplyr` & `ggplot`

You can find presentation slides covering all content and the full code at the end of the post.

# Accessing Apple Health Data

![](/img/Steps.png)

## Step 1

Open the Apple Health app on your phone, then **summary page** at the top right, then tap the circle showing the first letter of your first name on the top right (left figure above).

## Step 2

Slide down and tap ‘Export All Health Data’ (middle figure).

## Step 3 

The export takes up to a few minutes, then a page to email or message it will pop up. Email this file to yourself and download it.

If you don't have an Apple watch and want to use my data, you can [download my `.xml` file here](https://drive.google.com/uc?export=download&id=1ExH8l_OZq84S6jsY26vP8fmemX6YmYIh).

<br>

# Opening Apple Health data

You can open the `.zip` folder directly using R, however for this project I'll manually extract the file within the folder named `apple_health_export`.

Inside, there'll be 2 files. For our purposes, you only need the **export** file.

I've made a new folder that houses all files, and this is where my working directly will be set. In Rstudio, I'll create an R script and load the packages I need. If you don't have these packages installed use `install.packages("packagename")` before loading them with `library()`. 

```{r emojis and icons, include=FALSE}
library(emo)
library(fontawesome)
```

```{r Load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("XML")
library("methods")
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
```


# Why do this in R?

![](/img/R.png)

<br>

### R is reproducible | Microsoft Excel is not

We could simply export the raw data into Excel and manipulate / visualise it there, but R isn't that difficult, and there are lots of resources out there to help learn it.

Have the **end game** in mind.

<br>

# Import the data into R

The file format (XML; Extensible Markup Language) is quite easy to work with in R using the `XML` package.

If you have multiple `.xml` files you can use a loop to access them all - I'll only be using one file for this example and it's saved in my working directory.

First, we need to make an object that I'll call `xml` and view it's contents using `summary(xml)`.

<br>

```{r Open XML, echo=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE}
xml <- xmlParse(paste("heidi-thornton_apple-data.xml"))
summary(xml)
```

<br>

# View the data

I'm interested in the workout data. We can open this using `xmlAttrsToDataFrame()`.

```{r Open df_workout, echo=TRUE}
df_workout <-  XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(xml["//Workout"])[c(1:2, 4, 6, 12)]
head(df_workout, n = 5) # View the top 5 rows of data
```

Here we have the session type and the respective data for each day (in need of some cleaning).

<br>

# Plotting data 

Lets start by filtering so only the data I want to plot remains.

We will use `%>%` (pipes) from the `tidyverse` package perform this as it's much quicker than making new data frames for each plot, and we'll plot the data using `ggplot2`.

<br>

### Daily running sessions

```{r Distance Graph ouput, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, font.size=10}
df_workout %>%
  
    # Change data types (i.e. distance to m not km, numeric) 
      mutate(
        workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
        totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000,
        duration = as.numeric(duration),
        endDate = as.Date(endDate)) %>% 
  
    # Only running sessions- depending on watch the name may differ
      filter(workoutActivityType == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning") %>%
      filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23") %>% # only after shut down

# Create ggplot    
ggplot(aes(x= endDate, y = totalDistance)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='#5ab4ac')+
    labs(title = "Not exactly periodised, but it's better than nothing....",
           subtitle = "Daily running volume (m)",
           x = "Date",
           y = NULL) +
    scale_x_date(date_breaks = "7 days",
                   date_labels = "%b %d") + 
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    theme_minimal() +
    theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "black", size = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```   

Now we have our first plot showing my running over the days after the COVID shut down.

<br>

### Weekly running volume

We need to manipulate the data a bit more to get the weekly running volume.

```{r Weekly volume, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_workout %>%
  
   mutate(
    workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
    totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000,
    endDate = as.Date(endDate),
    week = isoweek(ymd(endDate))) %>% # Add week column
  
   filter(workoutActivityType == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning") %>%
   filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23") %>%
   group_by(week) %>% # summarise by week (starts week in 1st jan)
  
ggplot(aes(x = week, y = totalDistance)) + 
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill='#5ab4ac') +
  labs(title = "Cardinal rule of training: Be consistent",
       subtitle = "Total distance (m) across annual weeks",
       x = "Annual Week",
       y = NULL) +
  scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
  scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13, 19, 1)) +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "black", size = 1),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

<br>

### Energy consumption

I want to know energy consumption by **activity type**. To extract a clean name for this we need to do some string manipulation using the `str_sub()` function from the `stringr` package (part of the `tidyverse`).

```{r energy graph, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_workout %>%
  
   mutate(
      workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
      totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance)) * 1000,
      totalEnergyBurned = as.numeric(as.character(totalEnergyBurned)),
      endDate = as.Date(endDate), 
      
      # Add week column
      week = isoweek(ymd(endDate)), 
      
      # new column- text after 22nd character
      Type = str_sub(workoutActivityType, 22)) %>%
  
   # Filter out cycling
   filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23" & Type %in% c('Running','Other')) %>% 
   group_by(week) %>%

ggplot(aes(x = week, y = totalEnergyBurned, fill = Type)) + 
    geom_bar(stat = "identity", position = position_dodge()) + 
    facet_wrap(~Type) +
    labs(title = "Weekly energy consumption (kj) by activity type",
        subtitle = "'Other' sessions include weights or walking",
        y = NULL,
        x = "Annual week") +
    scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13, 19, by = 1)) +
    scale_y_continuous(expand = c(0, 0)) +
    theme_minimal() + 
    theme(legend.position = "none",
          panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
          panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
          axis.line.x = element_line(colour = "black", size = 1),
          axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
          strip.text = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

<br>

### General activity data

Lets move on from workout data and import 'Record' data. This one will take a while to load.

```{r Import record data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_record <-  XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(xml["//Record"]) [c(1,6,8)]

# See data types available in record
  df_record %>% 
    mutate(Type = str_sub(type, 25)) %>% # Include text after the 25th character
    select(Type) %>% distinct
```

If you want to view the full dataset, you can use `view(df_record)`.

<br>

### Step data manipulation

This one isn't exactly useful for athletes - this is more for my own interest of my activity (or lack of) during the COVID shut down.

I am replicating a plot created by [Taras Kaduk](https://twitter.com/taraskaduk) on his blog post titled [Analyze and visualize your iPhone's Health app data in R](https://taraskaduk.com/2019/03/23/apple-health/).


```{r Step count plot by hour, echo=TRUE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}

df_record %>%
  
   mutate(
      # Rename type by removing that text 
       Type = str_remove(type, "HKQuantityTypeIdentifier"), 
       value = as.numeric(as.character(value)),
       Date = as.Date.character(startDate),
       weekday = wday(Date), # Day of week
       hour = hour(startDate)) %>% # Need to use the factor date
   filter(Type == 'StepCount' & Date >= "2020-03-23") %>%
   group_by(Date, weekday, hour) %>%  # Summarise by date, weekday and hour
   summarise(value = sum(value)) %>% # Sum steps over ^^
   group_by(weekday, hour) %>% # Now summarise by weekday and hour  
   summarise(value = mean(value)) %>% # Take mean steps over ^^
   filter(between(hour,6,21)) %>% # Filtering to include between 6am - 9pm
 
ggplot(aes(x = hour, y = weekday,  fill = value)) +
  geom_tile(col = 'grey40') +
  scale_fill_continuous(labels = scales::comma,
                        low = 'grey95',
                        high = '#008FD5') +
  scale_x_continuous(
    breaks = c(6, 9, 12, 15, 18),
    label = c("6 AM", "9 AM", "Midday", "3PM", "6 PM")) +
  scale_y_reverse(
    breaks = c(1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7),
    label = c("Sunday",
              "Monday",
              "Tuesday",
              "Wednesday",
              "Thursday",
              "Friday",
              "Saturday")) +
  labs(
    title = "Not a lot of activity at the moment....",
    subtitle = "Step count heatmap by hour by day",
    y = NULL,
    x = NULL) +
  guides(fill = FALSE) +
  coord_equal() +
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(panel.grid.major = element_blank(),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```

<br>

### Heart rate data

One last one - we will plot HR across 2 days. I have added a colour scale for low (green) and high (red).

```{r HR Graph, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_record %>%
  mutate(Type = str_remove(type, "HKQuantityTypeIdentifier"), # Rename 
      value = as.numeric(as.character(value)), 
      startDate = as_datetime(startDate),
      Date = as.Date.character(startDate)) %>% 
      filter(Type == 'HeartRate') %>%
        filter(Date >= as.Date("2020-04-03") &  Date <= as.Date("2020-04-04")) %>%
  
ggplot(aes(x = startDate, y = value, colour = value)) +
  geom_line(size = 0.75) +
  scale_color_gradient(low = "springgreen3", high = "firebrick2") +
  labs(title = NULL,
       y = "Heart rate",
       x = NULL) +
  expand_limits(y = c(50, 200)) + 
  theme_minimal() +
  theme(legend.position = "none",
        panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        panel.grid.major.x = element_blank(),
        axis.title = element_text(face = "bold"),
        plot.title = element_text(face = "bold"))
```
