I'm a sports scientist and strength and conditioning coach based in Sydney, Australia.

I post my work and ideas on maximising sports performance on this site. You'll find practical information on athlete monitoring, training programming, data analysis, and anything else on my mind that I think is useful and interesting when preparing athletes and teams.
