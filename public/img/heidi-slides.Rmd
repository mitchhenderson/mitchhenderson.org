# Alternative Tracking Method


#### As sports scientists, during this COVID-19 shut, we have limmited ways of determining adherance or completion of training programs (which of course are completed within Govenment guidelines)!
--


As a **guide** to measure the training completed during this period is via activity watches
--


Whilst the reliability and validity of activity watches is not widely available, these measure basic metrics such as total distance, duration, HR, energy burnt etc
--


Here, I will run through how to export this data without an API, basic analysis and manipulation and will demonstrate a few plots using ***ggplot***

# Accessing Apple Health Data


**Step 1** - Click on apple health app on your phone, on summary page in the top right, click on circle with first name letter (figure on left)
--


**Step 2** - Slide down to ‘Export All Health Data’ (middle figure)
--


**Step 3** - This export will take up to a few minutes, then a page to email/message etc it will pop up. Simply email to yourself and download it

# Opening Apple Health Data


You can open the zip folder directly using R, however for this project I will extract the file that is within the folder'apple_health_export'.
--


Inside the 'apple_health_export' folder, there will be 2 files. For the purpose of this, you will only need the ‘export’ file
--


I have made a new folder that houses all files where I will set my working directly to this location and load packages. If you don't have these packages installed use install.packages("packagename")


```{r Working directory, echo=TRUE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
# setwd("C:/Users/Heidi.Thornton/Desktop/Apple")
```

```{r Load packages, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library("XML")
library("methods")
library("tidyverse")
library("lubridate")
```

# Why do this in R?

###R is reproducible - microsoft excel is not...
--



####We could simply export the raw data into excel and manipulate and visualise it there
--



####But...R isn't that difficult and there are lots of resources out there to help learn it
--


### Have the **end game** in mind


---

# Import the Data into R

The file format (XML; Extensible Markup Language) is quite easy to work with in R using the **XML** package
--


I have created a folder where I have put my xml file. If you have multiple files you can use a loop to access them all - I will only use one file though
--


First, we need to make an xml object and view it's contents using summary(xml)
--

```{r Open XML, echo=TRUE, paged.print=FALSE}
xml <- xmlParse(paste("heidi-thornton_apple-data.xml"))
summary(xml)
```

---

# View the Data

I'm interested in the workout data which we can open using **xmlAttrsToDataFrame**
--


```{r Open df_workout, echo=TRUE}
df_workout <-  XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(xml["//Workout"])[c(1:2,4,6,12)]
head(df_workout, n = 5) # View the data
```

--


Here we have the session 'type' and the respective data for each day which needs some cleaning up


---

# Plotting Data 

Now lets start with my running sessions which we need to filter
--


We will use %>% (pipes) from the **tidyverse** package as it is much quicker rather than making new data frames and will plot the data using **ggplot2**

--

```{r Distance Graph, fig.show='hide', font.size=10}
df_workout %>%
  
# Change data types (i.e. distance to m not km, numeric) 
    mutate(workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
        totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000, # convert to m not km
        duration = as.numeric(duration), # Change to numeric 
        endDate = as.Date(endDate)) %>%  # change date from factor format
# Only running sessions- depending on watch the name may differ
      filter(workoutActivityType == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning") %>%
      filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23") %>% # only after shut down

# Create ggplot    
ggplot(aes(x= endDate, y = totalDistance)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='#5ab4ac')+
      labs(title = "Running Sessions") +  # title
      ylab(bquote(bold("Total distance (m)"))) + # y axis title
      xlab(bquote(bold("Date")))+ # x axis title
      scale_x_date(date_breaks = "7 days") + 
        theme_minimal()  # remove some theme formatting
```  
  
  
---

# Daily Running Sessions

Now we have our first plot, showing running volume (m) by day, including days after the COVID shut down. Not exactly periodised, but it's better than nothing....
--


```{r Distance Graph ouput, echo=FALSE, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, font.size=10, fig.width=9, fig.height=5.8,fig.align='center'}
df_workout %>%
    # Change data types (i.e. distance to m not km, numeric) 
      mutate(workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
        totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000,
        duration = as.numeric(duration),
        endDate = as.Date(endDate)) %>% 
# Only running sessions- depending on watch the name may differ
      filter(workoutActivityType == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning") %>%
      filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23") %>% # only after shut down

# Create ggplot    
ggplot(aes(x= endDate, y = totalDistance)) +
    geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='#5ab4ac')+
      labs(title = "Running Sessions") +  # title
      ylab(bquote(bold("Total distance (m)"))) +
      xlab(bquote(bold("Date")))+
      scale_x_date(date_breaks = "7 days") + 
        theme_minimal()
```   

---

# Weekly Running Volume

We need to manipulate the data a bit more to get the weekly running volume
--

```{r Weekly volume, fig.align='center', fig.height=3, fig.width=5, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_workout %>%
   mutate(workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
    totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000,
    endDate = as.Date(endDate),
    week = isoweek(ymd(endDate))) %>% # Add week column
      filter(workoutActivityType == "HKWorkoutActivityTypeRunning") %>%
      filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23")%>%
          group_by(week)%>% # summarise by week (starts week in 1st jan)
ggplot(aes(x=week, y=totalDistance)) + 
  geom_bar(stat="identity", fill='#5ab4ac')+labs(title = "Running Sessions")+
  ylab(bquote(bold("Total distance (m)"))) +
  xlab(bquote(bold("Week")))+
  theme_minimal()
```

---

# Energy Consumption

I want to know energy consumption by **activity type** which we need to rename
--

```{r energy code, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.show='hide'}
df_workout %>%
   mutate(workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
          totalEnergyBurned = as.numeric(as.character(totalEnergyBurned)),
          endDate = as.Date(endDate), week = isoweek(ymd(endDate)), # Add week column
          Type = str_sub(workoutActivityType, 22)) %>% # new column- text after 22nd character
   filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23" & Type %in% c('Running','Other')) %>% # Filter out cycling
            group_by(week) %>%
  
ggplot(aes(x=week, y=totalEnergyBurned, fill=Type)) + 
     geom_bar(stat="identity", position = position_dodge()) +
       facet_wrap(~Type) +
       labs(title = "Energy Consumption by Session Type",
            x = bquote(bold("Week")),
            y = bquote(bold("Energy Consumption (kj)"))) +
       scale_x_continuous(breaks = seq(13, 19, by = 1)) +
         theme_minimal() + 
         theme(legend.position = "none")  
```

---

# Energy Consumption Plot

Now we can see weekly energy consumption by **activity type**. 'Other' sessions include weights or walking  
--


```{r energy graph, echo=FALSE, fig.align='center', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.width=10,fig.height=6}
df_workout %>%
   mutate(workoutActivityType = as.character(workoutActivityType),
      totalDistance = as.numeric(as.character(totalDistance))*1000,
      totalEnergyBurned = as.numeric(as.character(totalEnergyBurned)),
      endDate = as.Date(endDate), week = isoweek(ymd(endDate)), # Add week column
      Type = str_sub(workoutActivityType, 22)) %>% # new column- text after 22nd character #<<
        filter(endDate >= "2020-03-23" & 
          Type %in% c('Running','Other')) %>% # Filter out cycling #<<
            group_by(week) %>% #<<

ggplot(aes(x=week, y=totalEnergyBurned, fill=Type)) + 
    geom_bar(stat="identity", position=position_dodge())+ 
      facet_wrap(~Type)+#<<
      labs(title = "Energy Consumption by Session Type")+
      ylab(bquote(bold("Energy Consumption (kj)"))) +
      xlab(bquote(bold("Week")))+
      scale_x_continuous( breaks = seq(13, 19, by = 1)) +
        theme_minimal() + 
        theme(legend.position = "none")
```

# General Activity Data

Lets move on from workout data and import 'Record' data. This one will take a fair while to load 

--


```{r Import record data, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
df_record <-  XML:::xmlAttrsToDataFrame(xml["//Record"]) [c(1,6,8)]
```

--

```{r Record variables}
# See data types available in record
  df_record %>% 
    mutate(Type = str_sub(type, 25)) %>% # Include text after the 25th character
    select(Type) %>% distinct
```
--

If you want to view the full dataset, you can use **head(df_record)**


---

# Steps Data Manipulation

This one isn't exactly useful for athletes - this is more for my own interest of my activity (or lack of) during the COVID shut down
I am replicating a plot created [online](https://taraskaduk.com/2019/03/23/apple-health/), demonstrating step count  
--

```{r Step count by hour, fig.show='hide', message=FALSE, warning=FALSE, fig.height=6,fig.width=8}
df_record %>%
mutate(Type = str_remove(type, "HKQuantityTypeIdentifier"), # Rename type 
       value = as.numeric(as.character(value)),
       Date = as.Date.character(startDate),weekday = wday(Date), # Day of week
       hour = hour(startDate)) %>% # Need to use the factor date
   filter(Type == 'StepCount' & Date >= "2020-03-23") %>%
     group_by(Date, weekday, hour) %>%  # Summarise by date, weekday and hour
       summarise(value = sum(value)) %>% # Sum steps over ^^
     group_by(weekday, hour) %>% # Now summarise by weekday and hour  
       summarise(value = mean(value)) %>% # Take mean steps over ^^
   filter(between(hour,6,21)) %>% # Filtering to include between 6am - 9pm
